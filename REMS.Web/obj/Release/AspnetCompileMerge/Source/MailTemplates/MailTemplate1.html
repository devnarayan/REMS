                    THIS NONDISCLOSURE AND NONCIRCUMVENT AGREEMENT (“<span class="ecxund"><u>Agreement</u></span>”) is made effective the
                    <span class="ecxund"> Day_Token </span> day of <span class="ecxund"> Month_Token </span>, <span class="ecxund"> Year_Token </span>, by and between Secured Investment Corp (“<span class="ecxund"><u>Company</u></span>”) and the undersigned “<span class="ecxund"><u>Recipient</u></span>.” Company and Recipient may
                    be individual referred to as a “<span class="ecxund"><u>Party</u></span>” or collectively as the “<span class="ecxund"><u>Parties</u></span>” in this Agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Company is in the business of underwriting and brokering hard money loans to real estate investors throughout the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recipient has funds available and is interested in exploring the real estate funding opportunities available through the Company (each individually an “<span class="ecxund"><u>Opportunity</u></span>” and collectively referred to as “<span class="ecxund"><u>Opportunities</u></span>”).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Company is prepared to make available to Recipient certain Confidential Information (defined below) regarding Opportunities. As a condition to such Confidential Information being furnished to Recipient, Recipient must agree to maintain the confidence of
                    the Confidential Information received from Company and must agree not to use such Confidential Information to the detriment of or to circumvent the Company.
                </p>
                <p>The Parties therefore agree as follows:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <span class="ecxund"><u>Definition of Confidential Information</u></span>. As used herein, the term “<span class="ecxund">Confidential Information</span>” means any and all confidential or proprietary information of the Company in whatever form, tangible or intangible,
                            relating to an Opportunity, including but not limited to, the name of the real estate investor/borrower, the real estate investor/borrower’s address, phone number, and email address, the real estate investor/borrower’s social security number, EIN number, and/or
                            business tax identification number, the real estate investor/borrower’s financial information, and all other information regarding the real estate investor/borrower and the Opportunity that has been or will be given to or shared with the Recipient by the Company.
                            The term “Confidential Information,” however, does not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by Company or its representatives; (ii) was within Recipient’s possession prior to its
                            being furnished to Recipient by or on behalf of Company (provided that the source of such information was not known to Recipient to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, Company
                            or any other party with respect to such information); or (iii) becomes available to Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than Company or any of its representatives (provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement
                            with, or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, Company or any other party with respect to such information).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            <span class="ecxund"><u>Confidentiality Obligations</u></span>. Recipient acknowledges that the Confidential Information is material, confidential, and greatly affects the goodwill and the effective and successful conduct of the Company and its business and operations,
                            and that maintaining confidentiality of the Confidential Information is necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Company.
                        </p>
                        <ol type="a">

                                    <span class="ecxund"><u>Non-Disclosure; Use of Confidential Information</u></span>. The Recipient shall hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall not disclose any Confidential Information except as is reasonably necessary to evaluate an Opportunity.
                                    Recipient agrees to use the Confidential Information only the purposes of evaluating an Opportunity;
                                    <span class="ecxita">provided, however</span>, that any third party that Recipient provides Confidential Information to, in order to evaluate an Opportunity, must be made aware of the Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement. Except as necessary to evaluate
                                    an Opportunity, Recipient shall keep confidential all Confidential Information and shall not directly or indirectly disclose, distribute, publish, divulge, reveal or communicate to any third party any Confidential Information. The Recipient’s duty of confidentiality
                                    shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
                                </p>

                                            <span class="ecxund"><u>Exception: Legal Proceedings</u></span>. If Recipient is requested or required (pursuant to a legal action or other similar proceeding) to disclose Confidential Information, Recipient shall provide Company with prompt written notice of any
                                            such request or requirement so that Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. Recipient shall use its best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information,
                                            including, without limitation, by cooperating with Company to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.

                                    <span class="ecxund"><u>Protection of Confidential Information</u></span>. Recipient agrees to undertake reasonable precautions to safeguard and protect the Confidential Information, to accept responsibility for any breach of this Agreement, and take all reasonable
                                    measures (including but not limited to court proceedings) to protect against any prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or uses of the Confidential Information.

                                    <span class="ecxund"><u>Return of Confidential Information</u></span>. Within five (5) days following a request from the Company, the Recipient shall deliver to the Company all tangible copies of the Confidential Information, including but not limited to, magnetic
                                    or electronic media containing the Confidential Information, note(s) and paper(s) in whatever form containing the Confidential Information or parts thereof, and any copies of the Confidential Information in whatever form. Recipient, at its sole option, may
                                    elect instead to destroy all copies of the Confidential Information and certify in writing to the Company that the Confidential Information has been completely destroyed; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall require Recipient to destroy
                                    any backup tapes or similar documents maintained for archival purposes.
                                </p>

                                    <span class="ecxund"><u>Non-Circumvention</u></span>. Recipient shall not use, pursue or exploit any Confidential Information for its own benefit to the detriment of Company. Specifically, without the Company’s express written consent, Recipient shall not circumvent
                                    the Company, directly or indirectly, by loaning money to any real estate investor/borrower introduced to the Recipient by the Company; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Recipient from working with investors and borrowers previously
                                    known to Recipient, or who first approach Recipient, directly or through third parties, even if the Company discloses Confidential Information to Recipient about those investors or borrowers. Additionally, Lender agrees not to undertake any action, operation
                                    or transaction that would attempt to denigrate Company’s relationship with its customers and clients.

                            appropriate. This right shall be in addition to any other remedy available to the Company in law or equity, as nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to preclude Company from pursuing any remedy available to Company.

Each Party specifically acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement and its interpretation and enforcement are governed by the laws of the State of Idaho. Furthermore, each Party irrevocably (i) submits to the jurisdiction

                            (ii) agrees that all claims in respect of any Proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any immunity from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process therein, (iv) agrees not
                            to commence any Proceeding other than in such courts and (v) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim that such Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum. The substantially prevailing Party will be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees
                            from the substantially non-prevailing Party incurred in connection with the prevailing Party’s efforts to enforce this Agreement, regardless of whether any action or proceeding is commenced. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties
                            and supersedes any prior understandings or agreements, written or oral, that relate to the subject hereof. This Agreement may not be amended except by a writing signed by each Party. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement is determined by a tribunal
                            of competent jurisdiction to be legally invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the remainder of the Agreement will not be affected and such provision will be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision consistent with applicable
                            law and, in its modified form, such provision will then be enforceable and enforced. Recipient may not assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company. Any purported assignment without the Company’s prior
                            written consent will be void <span class="ecxita">ab initio</span>. This Agreement is binding upon the Parties and will bind and inure to the benefit of their executors, personal representatives, legatees, heirs, successors and assigns. No waiver by any Party
                            of any right or default under this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving Party. No such waiver will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent right or default or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior
                            or subsequent such occurrence. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same Agreement. The counterparts of this Agreement may be executed and
                            delivered by facsimile or other electronic signature (including, but not limited to, DocuSign) by any of the parties to any other party and the receiving party may rely on the receipt of such document so executed and delivered by facsimile or other electronic
                            means as if an originally hand signed original had been received.
